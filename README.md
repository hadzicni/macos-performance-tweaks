## Warnings

- Some tweaks require root privileges (sudo).
- Disabling Spotlight indexing will make search unavailable until re-enabled with sudo mdutil -a -i on.
- Cleaning caches may cause apps to rebuild data (slower start until reindexed).
- Changes may affect system features or third-party applications.
- Use at your own risk!
